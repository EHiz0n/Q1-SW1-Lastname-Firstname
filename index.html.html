    <h1 style="text-align: center;">The Art of Muay Thai</h1>
    <p><strong>Muay Thai</strong> is a martial art originating in Thailand and it is originally derived from Muay Boran, the forerunner of <strong>Muay Thai.</strong> <strong>Muay Thai</strong> is one of the many common martial arts within the fighting background and is known to be lethal to the opponent and oneself compared to other martial art styles like <strong>Boxing</strong> and <strong>Taekwando</strong>.

This was because of his extensive neck and body training which helped him gain resistance.</p>
